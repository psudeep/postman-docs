> __[Static IP address monitoring is available on Postman Professional and Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing)__

Postman's static IP feature enables you to monitor your APIs that are behind a restricted firewall. This feature is available to all Postman Professional and Enterprise customers, provided your IT team [allowlists](#allowlisting-static-ip-addresses) the associated static IP addresses.

The provided static IP addresses are fixed to their specified region and shared by all customers who use this feature.
